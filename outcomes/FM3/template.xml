        Suppose that <m>{{x}}</m> and <m>{{y}}</m> are related
        by a linear model and that
        when <m>{{x}} = {{x1}}</m>, <m>{{y}} = {{y1}}</m>,
        and that when
        <m>{{x}} = {{x2}}</m>, <m>{{y}} = {{y2}}</m>.
        Find the slope and <m>y</m>-intercept of the model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The slope is <m>{{slope}}</m> and
        the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>{{intercept}}</m>.
